# Somfy3D-Print
Drive motor for Somfy Units

I bought some Somfy Blind motors from ebay not too long ago after automating some of my other blinds using the same motors, when I recieved them I was surprised to learn that Somfy do not make the adapters required available for anyone to purchase, as a result I set about making my own adapters to be connected to the Somfy Blind Motor.

These are provided in this repository as well as available on thingiverse for anyone else who like me ended up with the motors with no way of connecting them to the blinds I had. These ones are designed to fit a 40mm tube however can be adapted, I may have already converted some and will upload if I find them.
